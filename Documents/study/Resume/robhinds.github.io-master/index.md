# Biography
I am a 4th year undergrad student at Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat,India. Strongly passionate about deep learning and AI.
I have been working in this feild for past two years and have got the oppurtunity to work on all kinds and sizes of data. My expertise lies in quick adaptaion to domain of data, designing optimized input pipeline architecture and scalable GPU implementation of deep learning models on tensorflow. I have worked on projects from different domains including Computer Vision, Hardware, Time Series Data,
Acoustics, Nuclear Physics, Agriculture and Medical Imaging. In nutshell there are only two things in my life, deep learning and Bodybuilding. 


# Education

# Research
Currently, I am involved in projects requiring analysis of whole boly MRI scans, Plasma current confinement in tokamak and agricultural issues in India.

#### Predicting the dynamics of Tokamak discharge <br> (Department of Atomic Energy, India)  
- The aim of the research was to anticipate the phenomenon of Disruption during Plasma confinement in Aditya Tokamak.
- We were able to anticipate the disruption of plasma current 12ms prior to the actual disruption (4ms earlier than the state-of-the-art models).
- The model was developed in Tensorflow using LSTM, and was successfully tested, giving real time inferencing with an accuracy of 95%.
- Input features included the readings of various diagnostics like plasma current, mirnov oscillations, loop voltage, bolo meter readings and many other.

#### Full-body Tumor segmentation from MRI scans
- Detection of tumorous regions in MRI body scans, using 3D fully-convolutional neural networks.
- Studying the progression of this segmentation in predicting the severity of the disease.

#### Analysis of crop health
- Detection of crop species and diseases using image data.
- Predicting severity of the disease using the above information along with other parameters like soil, weather, region etc.
- Recommending preventive measures for the disease.

#### Speech Emotion Recognition [link](https://github.com/amanbasu/speech-emotion-recognition)
- Prediction of human emotions from raw audio using IEMOCAP database.
- Bidirectional LSTM was used along with local attention mechanism to focus on the part of speech which influence the emotion more.
- The architecture was trained on NVIDIA K80 system and gave results comparable to the state-of-the-art models.

#### Autonomous Car [link](https://github.com/amanbasu/Autonomous-Car-Prototype)
- A self-driving RC car which maneuvered itself on an indoor, hand-made track.
- Convolutional Neural Network was used to classify the direction of car from dashcam images.
- The model was able to achieve a classifying accuracy of 94%.

# Other Projects

#### Wireless Irrigaton System using Arduino and GSM module(2015)
- This project was developed for controlling irrigaton pump via a SMS. 
- Interfacing of pump was done with arduino by using a 25V relay. 
- Arduino was interfaced tith SIM 900 Module (GSM Board).   

#### Gesture Controlled mouse
- The aim of this project was to control the hovering of mouse.
- Mouse can be hovered using one finger and clicked using other. 
- Contour filtering techniques were used to achieve segmentation of colors of ribbons wrapped on fingers.
- Project was developed using javacv, collection of wrapper classes of opencv. 

#### Hand Gesture recognition
- Sementation of hand was done using black colored gloves. 
- Opencv was used for real time hand detection and also the number of fingers shown at any point of time. 
- The main technique used in this project was detection of a convex hull for detecting hand as a whole and then
  detecting the defects in convexity for measuring length of fingers.
